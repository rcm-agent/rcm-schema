## Key Changes

1. **Database Structure**:
   - Removed direct `org_id` foreign key from `app_user` table
   - Added `user_organization` association table with composite primary key
   - Added support for multiple organizations per user

2. **Model Relationships**:
   - AppUser now has many UserOrganizations (many-to-many)
   - Organization now has many UserOrganizations (many-to-many)
   - UserOrganization links users and organizations

3. **New Features**:
   - `is_primary` flag to designate primary organization
   - `is_active` flag to soft-delete associations
   - `joined_at` timestamp to track membership history
   - Unique constraint ensuring only one primary org per user

## Migration Instructions

1. **Review the changes** in `models.py`
2. **Run the migration**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using Alembic
   source venv/bin/activate
   alembic upgrade head
   
   # Option 2: Using direct SQL
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f migrations/add_user_organization_table.sql
   ```

3. **Update application code** that references `user.org_id` to use the new relationship

## Files That May Need Updates

Based on search results, these files reference the old user-org relationship and may need updates:

1. `/Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema/tests/unit/test_models.py` - Test expecting `user.org_id`
2. `/Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema/examples/v8_multi_tenant_example.py` - Example code using `AppUser.org_id`
3. `/Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema/V8_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Documentation showing old relationship

## Next Steps

1. Run the migration in a test environment first
2. Update application code to use the new many-to-many relationship
3. Update tests to reflect the new structure
4. Consider adding helper methods to AppUser for backward compatibility:
   ```python
   @property
   def primary_org_id(self):
       primary = next((uo for uo in self.organizations if uo.is_primary), None)
       return primary.org_id if primary else None
   ```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the migration can be rolled back:
- Alembic: `alembic downgrade -1`
- SQL: Use the rollback script in the SQL file comments
