# V8 Migration Status: READY TO EXECUTE

## Current Status
- ✅ Migration scripts prepared
- ✅ All V2 APIs implemented
- ⚠️ Database migration pending (requires PostgreSQL connection)

## Migration Files Ready
1. `/Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema/direct_v8_migration.sql` - Complete SQL migration
2. `/Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema/run_v8_migration.py` - Python migration runner
3. `/Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema/scripts/validate_v8_migration.py` - Validation script

## To Execute Migration

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-orchestrator
./deploy_v8.sh
```
This will automatically run the migration as part of deployment.

### Option 2: Direct SQL Execution
```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d rcm_db < /Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema/direct_v8_migration.sql
```

### Option 3: Using Python Script
```bash
cd /Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema
python3 run_v8_migration.py
```

## Post-Migration Validation
```bash
cd /Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema
python3 scripts/validate_v8_migration.py
```

The migration is fully prepared and will execute automatically when PostgreSQL is accessible.
