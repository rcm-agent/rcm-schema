# RCM Schema V8 Migration - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive migration plan and deliverables created for updating the RCM system to the new V8 schema, which introduces multi-tenancy, graph-based workflows, and machine learning capabilities.

## Delivered Files

### 1. Database Migration
- **File**: `alembic/versions/007_migrate_to_v8_schema.py`
- **Purpose**: Complete Alembic migration script with:
  - Lookup table creation (replacing ENUMs)
  - Multi-tenant organization structure
  - Graph-based workflow tables
  - Backward compatibility views
  - Data migration for existing records

### 2. SQLAlchemy Models
- **File**: `models_v8.py`
- **Purpose**: Complete ORM models for V8 schema including:
  - Organization and multi-tenant support
  - Channel types and endpoints
  - Graph workflow nodes and transitions
  - Vector embeddings for micro states
  - Bridge tables for many-to-many relationships

### 3. Pydantic Schemas
- **File**: `schemas_v8.py`
- **Purpose**: API validation and serialization models:
  - Request/response schemas for all entities
  - Validation rules and constraints
  - Backward-compatible enums
  - Pagination and error response models

### 4. Migration Guide
- **File**: `V8_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive migration instructions:
  - Phase-by-phase migration plan
  - Service-specific update instructions
  - Testing strategies
  - Rollback procedures
  - Monitoring recommendations

### 5. Implementation Example
- **File**: `examples/v8_multi_tenant_example.py`
- **Purpose**: Working example demonstrating:
  - Multi-tenant authentication
  - Organization context management
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Vector similarity search
  - Graph workflow execution
  - FastAPI endpoints with proper scoping

## Key Architecture Changes

### 1. Multi-Tenancy
- All data now scoped to organizations
- Row-level security through org_id filtering
- JWT tokens include organization context
- Sys_admin role for cross-org access

### 2. Graph-Based Workflows
- Replaced linear workflows with DAG structure
- `workflow_node` and `workflow_transition` tables
- Support for parallel execution
- Complex branching logic

### 3. Machine Learning Integration
- `micro_state` table with 768D vector embeddings
- pgvector extension for similarity search
- HNSW indexing for performance
- Support for UI state learning

### 4. Flexible Configuration
- ENUMs replaced with lookup tables
- Runtime extensibility
- No database migrations needed for new values

### 5. Enhanced Relationships
- Bridge tables for many-to-many mappings
- Multi-endpoint trace support
- Channel abstraction layer

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Backup existing database
2. Enable pgvector extension
3. Run migration script
4. Verify backward compatibility views

### Phase 2: Core Services (Weeks 2-4)
1. **rcm-orchestrator**: Add org context, update queries
2. **rcm-memory**: Integrate vector search, update storage
3. **rcm-web-agent**: Update API clients, domain models

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 5)
1. Unit tests for multi-tenancy
2. Integration tests for workflows
3. Performance tests for vector search
4. End-to-end validation

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 6)
1. Staging environment validation
2. Production deployment
3. Monitoring setup
4. Performance tuning

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Security
- Row-level security for tenant isolation
- JWT tokens with organization context
- Credential storage via AWS SSM/Secrets Manager
- Audit trails with workflow traces

### 2. Performance
- HNSW indexing for vector search
- Optimized indexes for common queries
- Connection pooling with asyncpg
- Batch processing support

### 3. Maintainability
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Comprehensive type hints
- Extensive documentation

### 4. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling via org sharding
- Async processing throughout
- Queue-ready batch jobs
- Stateless API design

## Next Steps

The foundation is now in place for migrating the RCM system to V8. The actual service updates (rcm-orchestrator, rcm-memory, rcm-web-agent) can proceed using the patterns and examples provided.

### Immediate Actions
1. Review and approve migration plan
2. Set up test environment with V8 schema
3. Begin Phase 1 database migration
4. Start updating services following the guide

### Future Enhancements
1. Add GraphQL API for complex queries
2. Implement workflow versioning
3. Add real-time updates via WebSockets
4. Integrate more ML models for state prediction

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Views ensure existing code continues working
2. **Data Integrity**: Foreign keys and constraints prevent invalid data
3. **Performance**: Indexes and query optimization prevent slowdowns
4. **Rollback Plan**: Complete backup and restore procedures documented

## Success Metrics

- Zero downtime during migration
- No data loss or corruption
- API response times remain under 100ms
- Vector search completes in under 50ms
- All existing functionality preserved

This migration positions the RCM system for significant growth with enterprise-grade multi-tenancy, advanced workflow capabilities, and machine learning integration.
