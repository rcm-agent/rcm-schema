# Schema Consistency Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-14
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Problem Identified

The rcm-schema repository had a critical inconsistency:
- Migration 017 created `user_workflow_node` and `user_workflow_transition` tables
- `models_v8.py` was updated with the new schema (UserWorkflowNode, UserWorkflowTransition)
- **BUT** `models.py` (the actual imported file) was never updated
- Services importing from `rcm_schema` were getting the old schema (WorkflowNode, WorkflowTransition)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated models.py
✅ Replaced WorkflowNode with UserWorkflowNode class:
- Changed from BIGINT node_id to UUID node_id
- Added workflow_id foreign key for ownership
- Renamed 'code' field to 'label'
- Updated metadata column handling

✅ Replaced WorkflowTransition with UserWorkflowTransition class:
- Added workflow_id for workflow ownership
- Changed node references from BIGINT to UUID
- Updated relationship definitions

### 2. Updated UserWorkflow Relationships
✅ Added missing relationships:
- `nodes` relationship to UserWorkflowNode
- `transitions` relationship to UserWorkflowTransition

### 3. Fixed MicroState References
✅ Updated node_id from BIGINT to UUID
✅ Changed foreign key from 'workflow_node.node_id' to 'user_workflow_node.node_id'
✅ Updated relationship from WorkflowNode to UserWorkflowNode

### 4. Updated __init__.py Exports
✅ Added new workflow models to exports:
- UserWorkflow
- UserWorkflowNode
- UserWorkflowTransition
- WorkflowRevision
- MicroState

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema/models.py`
   - Lines 301-350: Replaced workflow node classes
   - Line 363-364: Added nodes and transitions relationships
   - Line 398: Changed node_id to UUID in MicroState
   - Line 425: Updated node relationship to UserWorkflowNode

2. `/Users/seunghwanlee/rcm-schema/__init__.py`
   - Added workflow model imports
   - Added workflow model exports to __all__

## Verification

✅ UserWorkflowNode class exists at line 301
✅ UserWorkflowTransition class exists at line 333
✅ UUID node_ids confirmed at lines 305 and 398
✅ Relationships properly defined at lines 363-364
✅ All workflow models exported in __init__.py

## Design Pattern

This follows a **simple, scalable industry-standard pattern**:
- **Clear ownership**: Nodes belong to workflows (1-to-many)
- **UUID identifiers**: Frontend-compatible, globally unique
- **Explicit relationships**: No ambiguity in data ownership
- **Standard ORM patterns**: SQLAlchemy best practices

## Next Steps

1. **Test the changes**: Run application to verify schema works
2. **Run migration**: Execute migration 017 if not already applied
3. **Update services**: Ensure all services import from rcm_schema correctly
4. **Remove old tables**: After verification, drop workflow_node and workflow_transition tables
