## Key V8 Features Now Documented

### 1. Lookup Tables (Replacing ENUMs)
- task_domain_lu
- task_action_lu
- job_status_lu
- user_role_lu
- org_type_lu
- And more...

### 2. Multi-Tenant Tables
- organization (root tenant)
- app_user (renamed from rcm_user)
- All tables include org_id
- RLS policies for isolation

### 3. Graph Workflow Tables
- workflow_node (DAG vertices)
- workflow_transition (DAG edges)
- user_workflow (instances)
- micro_state (768D embeddings)

### 4. Channel Abstraction
- channel_type (global catalog)
- endpoint (org-specific config)

## Migration Path

The documentation provides a clear migration path:

1. **Schema Migration**: Use alembic migration 007_migrate_to_v8_schema.py
2. **Code Updates**: Follow patterns in V8 guides
3. **API Migration**: Use V2 endpoints with org context
4. **Gradual Transition**: Backward compatibility views allow phased migration

## Next Steps

1. **Validate**: Review all V8 documentation for accuracy
2. **Train**: Use guides to train development teams
3. **Update**: Keep docs current as V8 features evolve
4. **Archive**: Consider moving V3 docs to archive folder

## Summary

The RCM schema documentation has been comprehensively updated for V8. All major concepts including multi-tenancy, graph workflows, lookup tables, and ML integration are now properly documented with examples and best practices.
