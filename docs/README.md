# RCM Schema Documentation

This directory contains the technical documentation for the Hybrid RCM platform database schema.

> **ðŸš€ V8 Schema Update**: The schema has been upgraded to V8 with multi-tenancy, graph-based workflows, and ML capabilities. See [V8 Migration Guide](../V8_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details.

## Schema Overview

The RCM V8 schema uses PostgreSQL 16+ with pgvector extension for semantic search and multi-tenant isolation.

### V8 Table Categories

1. **Organization & Multi-Tenancy**
   - `organization` - Multi-tenant organizations with types (hospital, billing_firm, credentialer)
   - `app_user` - Application users with org association (renamed from rcm_user)
   - Row-level security across all tenant tables

2. **Channel & Endpoint Abstraction**
   - `channel_type` - Portal catalog/templates (replaces portal_type)
   - `endpoint` - Organization-specific portal configurations
   - `portal_credential` - Encrypted credentials per endpoint

3. **Graph-Based Workflows**
   - `workflow_node` - DAG nodes for workflow steps
   - `workflow_transition` - Edges defining workflow paths
   - `user_workflow` - Workflow instances with metadata
   - `workflow_trace` - Execution traces (renamed from rcm_trace)
   - `workflow_trace_endpoint` - Multi-endpoint support

4. **Task & Requirements**
   - `task_type` - Workflow templates with lookup-based domains/actions
   - `field_requirement` - Dynamic field requirements (being phased out)
   - `task_signature` - Execution patterns with source tracking
   - Hierarchical requirements system (payer â†’ org overrides)

5. **ML-Powered State Management**
   - `micro_state` - UI states with 768D vector embeddings
   - `macro_state` - State clustering for patterns
   - `rcm_state` - Legacy state table (compatibility)
   - `rcm_transition` - State transition graph

6. **Execution & Processing**
   - `batch_job` - Multi-tenant batch processing
   - `batch_job_item` - Individual batch items (renamed from batch_row)
   - Status tracking via lookup tables

7. **Lookup Tables** (Replacing ENUMs)
   - `task_domain_lu` - Task domains (eligibility, prior_auth, etc.)
   - `task_action_lu` - Task actions (check, submit, appeal, etc.)
   - `job_status_lu` - Job statuses
   - `user_role_lu` - User roles with org context
   - `org_type_lu` - Organization types
   - Additional lookup tables for flexibility

### V8 Key Features

- **Multi-Tenancy**: Complete organization-based isolation with RLS
- **Graph Workflows**: DAG-based execution with parallel processing
- **Vector Embeddings**: 768D for micro-states, 1024D for memory (BGE-M3)
- **Dynamic Schema**: Lookup tables allow runtime extension without migrations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Views maintain legacy table names (rcm_user, rcm_trace)
- **Channel Abstraction**: Flexible portal configuration without code changes
- **ML Integration**: pgvector with HNSW indexing for fast similarity search
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive tracking with organization context
